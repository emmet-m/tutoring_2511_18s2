# COMP2511 Tutorial work repository

## How to use this repository

You can clone/download the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/emmet-m/tutoring_2511_18s2)

These are not official solutions - Merely just a copy of what we created in class together for reference!

Try not to use these as a reference every time you code - You should be aiming to be able to write a decent portion of code from scratch without this as reference!

## Where are the questions for each code file?

You can find them on [WEBCMS3](https://webcms3.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP2511/18s2/resources/19272).
